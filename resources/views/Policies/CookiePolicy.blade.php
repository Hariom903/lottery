        <h3 class="text-primary mt-5 mb-3 fw-semibold">What are Cookies?</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
            Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.
            Like most websites, we use cookies to a limited extent to enhance the user experience and provide customisation and useful features to our website and products. We also use standard analytics software to allow us to see how our users are interacting with the site in aggregate.
            Since we are able to collect this data on you, we want to be as clear as possible about how we collect the data, what we collect and most importantly, what we do with it. The aim is to provide you, the user, with as much transparency and control as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
            So, what is a cookie? A ‘cookie’ is a small piece of information stored on your web-browser which allows your web-browser to remember specific information about a website or webpage.
            Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
            This ‘cookie’ provides us with useful information related to visitors to our website such as if you’re a unique visitor or if you have been to our website before. The time you spent visiting our website and which particular page you spent the longest time on, allowing us to calculate the average length of time users spend on our website. Also, how you found your way to our website, via a search engine or from a direct link.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
            In other words, we use cookies to make your experience on our site as easy and user friendly as possible. In addition, should you opt to disable cookies, our site will not work properly.
            Such cookies may be either “first party cookies” (set directly by us to your computer or mobile device) or “third party cookies” (set by third-party providers who work with us for purposes of functionality, performance/analytics, etc).
            <span class="fw-semibold text-success">We DO NOT send cookies to any third parties or sell any information derived from cookies.</span>
        </p>
